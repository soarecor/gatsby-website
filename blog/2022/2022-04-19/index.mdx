### At long last, I did it.

I figured out how to get .mdx files rendered here. Initially, I thought about going with a trendy headless CMS, but decided against it. Gatsby can parse .mdx quite painlessly. 

I used a tutorial by James Perkins - https://youtu.be/ujq0DaSa58Y. This tutorial helped setup my blog folder, template and gatsby-node.js file.  

I had to figure out just one missing peice of the puzzle. The `<Link />` component in Gatsby by default routes to the *relative* path. It follows the behaviour of Reach Router - https://reach.tech/router/nesting. Simply put, if I'm currently on the blog/ route and link to another page from here - by default this route will be preceded by /blog.

To solve the problem, I had to move up a directory, where my blog folder currently sits. I added a good ol' `../` before my slug and voila!

```
<StyledLink to={`../${item.slug}`}> <div className="name">{item.frontmatter.title}</div> </StyledLink>
```
