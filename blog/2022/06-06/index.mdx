### Is it possible to animate pitch at a certain elevation?

I'm stoked about my new gig at a tree planting company! One of my many tasks was to figure out how to animate the map as the user zooms past a certain elevation. It was was not obvious if Mapbox has a method to query the camera elavation, but they do have something close enough - getZoom()

getZoom() would allow me to find the equivalent of map elevation. Once you reach a certain height, animate the map to pitch to the desired angle. Looks something like this:

```
const zoomLevel = map.getZoom()

if( zoomLevel > 15) {
    map.easeTo({
        pitch: 80,
        speed: 0.2,
        curve: 1,
        duration: 5000,
        easing(t) {
        return t;
        }
    });
}
```  

While zoom level is not elevation, it is good enough. It does the job and can easily be attached to a 'zoom in' or 'zoom out' click handler!
