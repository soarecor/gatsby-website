### Building a Cardano Wallet connector is easier than it seems

If you have a Cardano wallet extension installed (like Yoroi, Nami or Eternl) it is possible to detect the wallet rather easily.
All you have to do is check for `window.cardano`. 

To set some sort of standard, the Cardano foundation has documented and launched the [CIP-30](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/) standard.

Once `window.cardano` is detected (you might have to wait a second), you can easily check if a wallet exists like this

```
if(window.cardano[{walletName}] !== undefined) {
    // append to a wallet list or do anything else
}
```

Once you have a list of wallets you can call the *enable* function on it but simply `await wallet.enable()`. The [enable](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/#cardanowalletnameenablepromiseapi) method returns a Promise which acts as an entry point to the contents of the wallet!
