### What happens when you authenticate your Github account on your Mac, then try using another account..

Long story short, I authenticated my personal Github account to use a work repository. When authenticating for the first time on a new Mac, Mac OS will create a new keychain record with your Github username and PAT as password.

Cool. So I now had to use my work Github account for the repository.

I created a new PAT on my work Github and tried to clone the repo. I got hit with
```
    Unauthorized  
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```  

This error does not tell you anything useful. After a few minutes, I figured out I had to change the Github keychain record to my work Github username *and* the new PAT I generated.
